            <h2>About Mucky Driver</h2>
            <p>
                Mucky Driver is a game where you upgrade through various cars and vehicles by collecting Points, Gems and CustomPoints all over the map. Furthermore, you can complete in-game
                challenges which give you something else to do while playing the game which will reward you for completing it. Missions can be completed by going through various different stages where you have to
                find the fastest and the best possible way past the obstacles to finish the mission succesfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mucky Driver consists of many other features such as; Fuel System, Cars, Lighting and more. Currently there are about 15+ cars/vehicles which can be found in the 
                game, in the future there would be more with better detail and more features. At this moment in time the car system is powered by A-Chassis which is a free model that 
                is used for nearly all free models cars on the toolbox - However, I hope to make my own system which will be easier to use and more useful features for Mucky Driver. 
            </p>

                The Fuel System consists of how much fuel is being used by each vehicle, which depends on how long you drive the vehicle for. There are two fuel stations which will provide
                you a re-fill for your vehicles, it will cost you about 50 CustomPoints to fully fill your tank back up. In addition to this, you cannot buy more fuel unless your current 
                fuel percentage is 20% or below. Once you have bought your fuel it will fully fill it to 100% of your tank. Different cars and vehicles will depleat your fuel faster 
                than others due to the consumption rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your choice is yours when playing Mucky Driver; Roleplaying, Challenges and Missions, Finishing the game or more! I hope to see you playing my game soon (or not).
