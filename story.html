            <h3 id="highlight">The Story of Raven and Muck County</h3>
            <p id="thin">
                You have been invited to the <b>Mucky Driver Group</b> where they tell you the story about how Raven and Muck County was created! 
                Everyone who had lived before had to experience the most devastating natural disaster ever recorded in that area. 
                The Tsunami took out most of the building's structure and damaged the shore near the town. After the disaster the government which was in charge at the time 
                (Raven County Government) had to stop maintaining half of their land where it became abandoned for many years after the disaster. 
                Mucky Driver Group was founded by a person who believed that the land left over should be re-claimed however for a different use. 
            </p>
            <p id="thin">
                The Mucky Driver Group was given permission by Raven County to make an official county called <b>Muck County</b>. 
                Muck County is quite different to Raven County in a couple of ways; The most noticable one would be the fact that there are no road laws in Muck County. 
                Due to no road laws there is a warning for fast moving vehicles before you cross into the county. The other main difference to Muck County is that it is the 
                only county nearby with a neighborhood which is a place where new people can stay / live in. 
                If they decide to move to Muck County there will be somewhere for people to move to. However, without Raven County's help this kind of speciality would not 
                be possible since Raven County provided the materials and the money for such things to be constructed.
            </p>
            <p id="thin">
                The community of Muck County decided to build an all brand new <b>nuclear station</b> which is located near the New Quarry which was flooded from the Tsunami. 
                The nuclear station would feed enough energy for all the homes and buildings within Muck County. 
                Raven County has their energy from some pass through electricity lines which provides enough power for all their buildings and houses. 
            </p>
            <p id="thin">
                The aftermath of the <b>Tsunami</b> left half of the Muck and Raven County with broken buildings, destroyed sea shores and knocked down trees. 
                Even though most of the damage was near the ocean side of both counties, it still did damage to other parts of the county. 
                The river flowing out to the ocean had risen dramatically due to the ocean rising - 
                so anything near the river would have been hit with a flash flood of some sort, still water damaging many buildings nearby. 
            </p>
            <p id="thin">
                A long time has past since the disaster, you would find Raven and Muck County working together making sure the safety of the land is at the top of their prority.
                 Raven County has constructed a new wave breaking wall which should stop a medium sized tsunami from damaging the town in the future. 
                <b>The Tsunami Prevention Company</b> is responsible for creating these barriers to prevent anything like the disaster which happened years before.
                After hearing how much has changed since the disaster you find great interest in offically joining the Mucky Driver Group.
