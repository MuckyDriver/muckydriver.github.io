            <h2>The Story of Raven and Muck County</h2>
            <p>
                You have been invited to the <b style="font-weight: 500;">Mucky Driver Group</b> where they tell you the story about how Raven and Muck County was created! Everyone who had lived before had to
                experience the most devastating natural disaster ever recorded in that area. The Tsunami took out most of the building's structure and damaged the shore near the town. 
                After the disaster the government which was in charge at the time (Raven County Government) had to stop maintaining half of their land where it became abandoned for many years after the disaster. Mucky Driver 
                Group was founded by a person who believed that the land left over should be re-claimed however for a different use.
