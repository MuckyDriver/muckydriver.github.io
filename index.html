                <div class="box"> <img src="img/Features/Cars.PNG"><h4 class="title">Cars</h4>
                    <p>There are 15+ vehicles which are currently in the game. To unlock more cars in the game you must go around the map collecting points and gems to then 
                        unlock the desired vehicles. In the VIP gamepass you get access to the almighty Monster truck which can nearly everywhere accross the map without any issues.
                        Every vehicle has their own specifications and systems which either mean it will use more fuel as you use it or it will additional features.
                    </p><p><b>Controls: </b>You can use WASD keys or the Arrow keys.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box"> <img src="img/Features/FuelSystem.PNG"><h4 class="title">Fuel System</h4>
                    <p>The fuel system is a feature where as you drive around the map the car will deduct the amount of fuel amount you have left across all cars. 
                    Different vehicles may have a higher consumption rate; For example the <b>Deslan Van</b> only uses 6 units per minute however the <b>Tanker</b> uses 
                    59 units per minute [UPM]. The profile is limited to 500 units of fuel.</p>
                    <p>Around the map there a 2 Fuel Stations which allow you to refuel your vehicle if you find yourself running low. The fuel station requires to have less than
                    20% fuel in your profile and 50 CustomPoints. If you have the right requirements it will restore your fuel amount to 500 Units / 100%. If you find
                    yourself empty and you are not near any of the Fuel stations then it is advised that you spawn any vehicle over the top of the Fuel Station prompt
                    area and get in the car to get more fuel.</p>

                <div class="box"> <img src="img/Features/ferry_task.png"><h4 class="title">Tasks</h4>
                    <p>Tasks is a feature which is in the main game to give you something to do and to get you around the map whilst also collecting some rewards along the way.
                    A task example would be finding your home or collecting a certain amount of points around the map. The rewards would either be points, gems or custom points</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box"> <img src="img/Features/Weather.gif"><h4 class="title">Weather</h4>
                    <p>The weather system alters the clouds to increase and decrease in scale over time, to keep it realistic it only changes slowly so you do not notice a change 
                        easily. When the clouds cover most of the sky at this point it will start to rain around the map. The weather system is completely random, which means it is 
                        different for every server.
